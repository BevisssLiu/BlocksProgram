# Learn about how to use Blocks

make this as a notebook for using block problem. In future, if there's any problem about block, I'd make a demo about it in this project.

So far, There are two main topic:
- Blocks Programming Topics [(it's from apple developer docs)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxVariables.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH6-SW2)
- Retain Cycle

Demo usage:
1. find the matched method with same cell title
2. read annotation and codes
3. press the cell and see the result on console
